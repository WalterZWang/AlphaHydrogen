# AlphaHydrogen

AlphaHydrogen is an open source OpenAI Gym environment that simulates the energy system of a residential community with distributed renewable power supply, fuel-cell vehicles, hydrogen stations, and power grid. Its objective is to advance the control of an integrated electricity-hydrogen building-vehicle-renewable energy system.

# Overview
Cleaner power production, distributed renewable generation, building-vehicle integration, hydrogen (H2) storage and associated energy infrastructures are promising candidates for transformation towards a carbon-neutrality community with district energy flexibility enhancement. AlphaHydrogen allows the easy implementation of advanced controll agents in a multi-agent setting to achieve customized goals: load shifting, CO2 emission reduction, operational cost saving, and etc.
